# Binary Classification (Kaggle Competition)

## Project Overview
This project aims to solve a binary classification problem, where memorable (label:1) and non-memorable (label:0) pictures in Brighton are provided as a training dataset. The goal for the classifier is to predict these labels, but for a test dataset in London i.e. _domain adaptation problem_. <br/>

In this classification problem, we observe training data (X_1,Y_1 )â€¦(X_247,Y_247) where X is a 4608-d feature vector; 4096 of them being deep CNNs features taken from the fc7 activation layer of CaffeNet, and the rest 512 being GIST features, and Y is the label {1,0}. <br/>

A variety of classifiers are tested; such as SVM, DT, etc. but they suffered from the Curse of Dimensionality i.e. low accuracy. <br/>

We are provided with the _confidence_ of each instance (which is the probability of the input to fall in a specific class), and the fact that logistic regression analysis is used to investigate the relationship between a binary response and a set of variables, a logistic regression model seems appropriate - with a bagging classifier.
